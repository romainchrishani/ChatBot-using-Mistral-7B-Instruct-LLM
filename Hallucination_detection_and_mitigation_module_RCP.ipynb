The Faculty was established in June 2001 to cater to the growing need of Information \\nTechnology professionals in the country. Presently, the Faculty conducts two int ernal degree \\nprogrammes, namely,  B.Sc. (Hons.) in Information Technology  and B.Sc. (Hons.) in Information \\nTechnology & Management , and the  Bachelor of Information Technology , the external degree \\nprogramme.  \\n \\nOne of the main objectives of setting up the faculty is to increase the number of IT \\nprofessionals in Sri Lanka by at least another 500. Some of the other objectives defined during \\nthe establishment of the faculty are the introduction of postgraduate progr ammes, carrying \\nout research programmes for the industry in order to solve technical problems, providing \\nconsultancies to the local industry and creating an educational environment for the continuous \\nprofessional development of IT professionals in Sri Lank a. \\n \\nThirteen batches of students have been admitted to the Faculty for the internal undergraduate \\nprogramme and out of these, 9 batches have already passed out after completing their studies \\nsuccessfully. The Faculty is conducting a  Master of Science in Information \\nTechnology , Masters of Science in Artificial Intelligence , Master of Philosophy and Doctoral \\ndegrees  as postgraduate programmes starting from early 2004. Also, a few professional \\ndevelopment programmes have been designed to address the immediate needs of the local IT \\nindustry. The current undergraduate student population is about 600.  \\nThe Faculty is committed to continue to develop and expand its activities catering to the ever \\nchanging needs of the IT industry and to become an entity which both the students and the \\nindustry would look up to.   \\n \\nThe faculty consists of three departments of study, and each department is managed by the \\nrespective Head of Department. The three departments are,   \\n• Department of Information Technology  \\n• Department of Computational Mathematics  \\n• Department of Interdisciplinary Studies  \\nPresently, the departments collaboratively offer subjects for the degree programmes \\nconducted by the Faculty. The relevant subjects of the programmes have been allocated \\namong the three departments.  Further, for the administrative purposes of the undergrad uate \\nand postgraduate programmes, two divisions have been established with each division headed \\nby a director. The Undergraduate Studies Division presently handles matters pertaining the \\nacademic affairs of the undergraduate study programmes of the Faculty . Students attendance \\nmonitoring and student feedback administration are also carried out by this Division. Matters \\npertaining to taught postgraduate programmes and research degrees are handled by the \\nPostgraduate Studies Division.', metadata={'source': '/tmp/tmpst8a08d8', 'page': 0})]\n",
