University of Moratuwa Vision To be the most globally recognized Knowledge Enterprise in South Asia Mission To be the leading Knowledge Enterprise for technological and related disciplines in South

nationally relevant and highimpact research to expand the boundaries of knowledge and to enhance the national technological capabilities Providing expert services to the State Industry and the Society as an Internationally Positioned Sri Lankan University and Contributing to sustainable scientific technological social and economic development of Sri Lanka The History The University of Moratuwa Sri Lanka was established by an Order under the Universities Act No 16 of 1978 but has its origins in the Ceylon Technical College of Maradana Colombo established in 1893 In 1960 the Institute of Practical Technology was founded at Katubedda with aid from the Government of Canada on a fifty acre block of land overlooking the Bolgoda Lake The primary aim of the i nstitute was to provide full time courses for technicians of sub professional grades In addition to the full time courses for Architects Junior Technical Officers Surveyors Levellers and Draughtsman Apprentices this institute also offered part time co urses in Engineering studies for those employed in the government and private sector and prepared students for foreign professional examinations of the Institutions of Engineering and the Royal Institute of British Architects The courses in Architecture however were transferred to the University of Ceylon Colombo when it established its own Department of Architecture The Institute of Practical Technology witnessed its first change of status six years after its inception The Government of Ceylon found that an effective system of specialized education and training capable of supplying the country with the necessary scientific and technical personnel was a prerequisite to achieve and sustain rapid development It therefore appointed a Comm ission of Inquiry on Technical Education in 1961 As engineering education at a higher level was provided exclusively by the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Ceylon Peradeniya this Commission in its report of 1963 recommended the expansion o f facilities to professional engineering education It was therefore decided to establish the Ceylon College of Technology at Katubedda utilizing the resources of the Institute of Practical Technology Assistance for this project was provided by the Uni ted Nations Development Programme through UNESCO', metadata={'source': '/tmp/tempfile'}), Document(page_content='10 The Ceylon College of Technology was thus begun with its new courses at a professional level in 1966 The Institute of Practical Technology continued in the same premises with its full time courses but was amalgamated with the Ceylon College of Technology in 1967 The engineering degree and technician programmes of the Ceylon College of Technology were designed to have an industrial bias with the inclusion of a compulsory period of in plant training so that the College would produce an engineer or a technic ian with practical training as an integral part of his study Within the next six years of its existence the Ceylon College of Technology earned University status under the provisions of the Universities Act No 1 of 1972 The University of Ceylon was established on the 15th of February 1972 incorporating all the existing universities and the Ceylon College of Technology as Campuses of a single university The Ceylon College of Technology thus became the Katubedda Campus of the University of Ceylon Th e Department of Architecture was transferred to this newly formed Campus from the University of Ceylon Colombo and the Technical Teacher and Instructor Training Institute at Ratmalana was established with aid from the International Labor Organization It began with just one Faculty that of Engineering and Architecture The first President of the Campus was Dr LH Sumanadasa who steered the progress of the institute from its inception as the Principal of the Institute of Practical Technology Later he w as appointed Vice Chancellor of the University of Ceylon When Ceylon subsequently became a Republic in 1972 the corporate name of the single University was changed to University of Sri Lanka In the meantime the departments of studies at the Katubedda Campus were expanded and new courses of studies at technician undergraduate and post graduate levels were introduced The School of Applied Science was established in 1974 The Sub Department of Rubber Technology now titled Polymer Technology wa s established in 1976 The Department of Town and Country Planning and sub departments of Textile Technology and Marine Engineering were established later Further changes in the corporate structure and composition were affected by the Universities Act N o 16 of 1978 Under the provisions of Section 1391 of this Act the Katubedda Campus of the University of Sri Lanka acquired the status of an independent University with its present corporate name University of Moratuwa Sri Lanka with three Faculties of studies via the Faculty of Engineering the Faculty of Architecture and Town Country Planning and the Faculty of Physical and Applied Sciences In 1981 the Faculty of Physical Applied Sciences was amalgamated with the Faculty of Engineering In August 1983 the Technical Teacher unit was transferred to the Ministry of Higher Education to function as an independent institution with its own premises In 1983 the Department of Building Economics was added to the Faculty of Architecture Two new departments of studies namely the Department of Computer Science Engineering and the Department of Textile Technology were established with effect from 18th January 1985 in the Faculty of Engineering The name of the Department of Textile Technology has now been changed to Textile and Clothing Technology to emphasize the equal importance given to clothing studies at the University of Moratuwa The latest addition in the Faculty of Engineering is the Department of Transport Logistics Management in Septe mber 2005 With effect from 10th March 2000
